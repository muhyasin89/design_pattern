#There is 3 types of Design Pattern
1. Creation
   - Prototype
   - Builder
   - Singleton
   - Factory
   - Abstract Factory

2. Structural
   - Proxy
   - Decorator
   - Facade
   - Adapter
   - Flyweight
   - Bridge
   - Composite

3.Behavioural
   - Chain of responsibility
   - Iterator
   - State
   - Strategy
   - Observer
   - Visitor
   - Template Method
   - Command
   - Momento
   - Mediator

1. Creational: 
These patterns are designed for class instantiation. They can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns.

2. Structural:
These patterns are designed with regard to a class's structure and composition. The main goal of most of these patterns is to increase the functionality of the class(es) involved, without changing much of its composition.

3. Behavioral:
These patterns are designed depending on how one class communicates with others.
   
   
What about anti-pattern? 
anti pattern is just fancy name, it same as structural no pattern at all.
